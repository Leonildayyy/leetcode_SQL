Question : Write a solution to find the the users who have had at least two session of the same type (either 'Viewer' or 'Streamer') with a maximum gap of 12 hours between sessions.
Logic: 
  1. For each user and session type, find the previous sessionâ€™s end time using LAG(session_end).
  2. LAG(session_end)
